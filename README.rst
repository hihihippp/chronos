Okay, how do I use it?
----------------------

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

From the command line::

    pip install trigger

Usage
~~~~~

To use trigger, run it from the command line::

    trigger

You should see a blank screen with a border.  Type ":" to bring up a command window at the bottom of the screen (yes, a la Vim).  The following commands are supported::

    n [title]   - Creates and starts a new timer.
    e[n][title] - Edits the title of the nth timer.
    p[n]        - Pauses/starts the nth timer.
    r[n]        - Resets the nth timer.
    q           - Quits the program.
    h           - Shows the help screen.

So, to create a timer titled, 'Test', simply type::

    :n Test

Then, to pause it::

    :p1

To reset it::

    :r1
